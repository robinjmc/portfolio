# Robin Cunningham
### Software Developer specialising in interface, performance & installation solutions.

Hiya! Welcome to my website. Here you can browse all my most recently completed projects. I've written a description for each, for background, context, tech used and any retrospective thoughts.

This visual repository has been written using my current 2 favourite languages React and Sass. It is responsively styled using CSS Grid, another favourite in my current tech stack.
