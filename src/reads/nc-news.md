NC News is a Full Stack development project completed within 2 weeks for the Northcoders project phase. It built using a Node.js backend and React frontend. It is styled with help from bootstrap and font awesome. The API reads data from the NoSQL database MongoDB. All TDD done using Mocha & Chai.

I have left the code base untouched (apart from security updates and fixes) to demonstrate what I was able to achieve within the 2 week period
