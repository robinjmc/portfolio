#  Lyall Hakaraia 
### Director. Designer. Mentor. Come explore the adventures of East Londonâ€™s Lyall Hakaraia.   
Collaboration between myself and Lyall Hakaraia for their personal website. The project saw me working closely with Lyall designing, building and collecting highlights from a 30+ year career.

With a vast archive to explore, the uploading and maintaining the content of the site was the emphasis of this project. With this in mind we decided to implement the design using Squarespace.

Squarespace has been a success for me and lyall in the past, where we have used it for their club/art space VFD. Squarespace allowed us to story board and collaborate across the country, in real time. Having set up the theme and structure, Lyall is also free to update and add more content to the site, without going through me. Non-developers can even go as far as changing the structure and design of the site, as has happened with VFD.
