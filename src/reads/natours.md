# Natours
### Natours is a nature-based travel agents, specialising in wildlife tours and outdoor holidays, designed & imagined by Jonas Schmedtmann.
It is one of three websites that I have produced following’s [Jonas’ ‘Advanced CSS and Sass’](https://codingheroes.io "Jonas Schmedtmann's Site") Udemy course.

Fulfilling the Natours projected introduced me to Sass/Scss, 7-1 CSS Architecture as well as building upon my knowledge of responsive design, animation and embedding video into HTML. 

Notable takeaways for me was the pure CSS pop-up, mixins and variables in Sass and the 7-1 Architecture concept. For me the modularity of the 7-1 concept lends itself well to React component driven design, something that I have explored on my Portfolio site.
