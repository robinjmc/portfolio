# Trillo
### A holiday booking site with hotels, flights, tours, transport options and varified lorem ipsum reviews!
As imagined & designed by [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://codingheroes.io "Jonas Schmedtmann's Site"), Trillo is one of three websites that I have produced taking Jonas' flagship course in Advance CSS teqnuies. As well as utilizing the advance tequices learnt elsewhere on the course, Trillo is an illustration of the power of the responsive CSS tool Flexbox. 

I was first introduced to flexbox whilst studying at Northcoder, however Schmedtmann's course gave me a huge insight to the real life benifits of using it. A one dimentional layout tool, it's perfect for building responsive, component based websites just like Trillo.
