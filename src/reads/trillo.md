# Trillo
### A holiday booking site with hotels, flights, tours, transport options and verified lorem ipsum reviews!
As imagined & designed by [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://codingheroes.io "Jonas Schmedtmann's Site"), Trillo is one of three websites that I have produced taking Jonas' flagship course in Advance CSS techniques . As well as utilising advance css methods learnt elsewhere on the course, Trillo is an illustration of the power of the responsive CSS tool Flexbox. 

I was first introduced to Flexbox whilst studying at Northcoders, however Schmedtmann's course gave me a huge insight to the real life benefits of using it. A one dimensional layout tool, it's perfect for building responsive, component based websites just like Trillo. 

The layout of Trillo would adapt very well to scaling up with a sister backend, serving up a small database similar to my NC News project. In the future I plan to, using Trillo as a starting point, expand this example website in a similar fashion with car rental, flights, tours, reviews and search pages following the Trillo design.
