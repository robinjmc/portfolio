# Fegbar
### No inspiration what to cook? Wanting to offset your carbon footprint and buy locally? Or just want to keep upto date with the seasons? 
Fegbar is the site for you! Just log on and you can see what fruit and vegetables are currently in season at your local shops, fill up your basket and calculate that you’re getting all the nutrients you need. 

Fegbar is a Full Stack development project completed within 2 weeks for the Northcoders project phase. As part of this project I had to create an original, achievable idea and pitch it to my tutors. It had to be a full stack development completed on my own. The backend SQL database serves up data via an API I wrote in Node.js where the  fruit and vegetables or ‘feg’ is fetched from. The API can serve up ‘feg’ based on month and type and the user has a basket of ‘feg’ that they can add to and remove from.

After finish building the project I presented my research and the mobile first website as part of the graduation day to others on the course and potential employers.

I have left the code base untouched (apart from security updates and fixes) to demonstrate what I was able to achieve within the 2 week period
