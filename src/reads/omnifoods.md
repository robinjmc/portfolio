# Omnifood
### Omnifood is a new premium food delivery & subscription service, that claims to operate in four cities across the world.
Imagined by [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://codingheroes.io "Jonas Schmedtmann's Site"), Omnifood is the product of his ‘Build Responsive Real World Websites with HTML5 and CSS3’ Udemy course, that I completed as a HTML/CSS refresher after finishing Northcoders.

Having taken on a Full Stack development role after graduation, this course realigned my focus on styling and structures of websites and was a great introduction for other key design concepts. 

I also really took onboard the animation and scroll effects. Along with the sticky navigation, these were features that I’d seen on many other websites and tutorials, so it was great to learn how to do them in a project that produced a fleshed out ready-to-go website.
