# Nexter
### Providing you with you're next luxury home
As imagined & designed by [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://codingheroes.io "Jonas Schmedtmann's Site"), Nexter is one of three websites that I have produced taking Jonas' flagship course in Advance CSS techniques. As well as utilising advance css methods learnt elsewhere on the course, including Flexbox, Nexter is an illustration of the power of the responsive CSS tool Grid. 

I was first introduced to Grid whilst studying at Northcoders, however Schmedtmann's course gave me a huge insight to the real life benefits of using it. I was impressed with the power Grid gives developers. With Grid we can traverse the web content's two dimensions with CSS, giving us total control of the layout and behaviours of the page's elements. Furthermore we can align even closer with the theory designer's use when creating evenly arranged screens, improving the speed and quality when delivering projects.
