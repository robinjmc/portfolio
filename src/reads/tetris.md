#   React Tetris
### On a retro tip! Play a remake of this addictive classic, made using React Hooks.
I developed this game as a result of following [Weibenfalk’s](http://work.weibenfalk.com "Weibenfalk’s Homepage") introduction to [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html "React Hooks Docs"), where I learnt about and implemented hooks such as setState, useEffect and useCallback. 

As well as being interested in learning about new features in the latest release of React, I was also interested in how, we’d make an application that was inherently dependant on user interaction with the webpage.

Looking forward I am certainly going to explore the inbuilt and custom hooks that React now offers further. As a developer, I’m interested in presenting new and exciting experiences that users have not yet explored on the web. Recreating games on the web can result in heavy loads and a slow UX, however with features that I implemented for this project such as React.memo, there is potential to present fast, complex and accessible experiences through the web.
